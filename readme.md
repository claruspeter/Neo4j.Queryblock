# Neo4j.Queryblock

## Purpose 
A collection of queryblock that can help write a Neo4j Cipher query
using the natural syntax (or as close as possible)
without resorting to too many magic strings.

## Example

[from Script.fsx](Script.fsx)

```` fsharp

    db.Cypher
        .Match( "(stagehog:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(stagehog)" )  
        .Return( "stagehog" )
        .Results

````
-- The original query using a "SQL"-like string for the Cipher match clause, 
and another string for the return variable that can't be compile-time checked.

```` fsharp

    let stagehog = ExpressionNode<Person>.Init "actorAndDirector" 

    db.Cypher
        .Match(  stagehog -| R<ACTED_IN>  |-> N<Movie> <-| R<DIRECTED> |- stagehog  )   
        .Return( stagehog )
        .Results

````
-- Current state of the queryblock that allow a _similar looking_ query,
that is compile-time checkable, including the return variable.
